# circulation-patron-web
A Circulation Manager web interface for library patrons.

## Running the application
This application requires either a [library registry](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/library_registry) or a [circulation manager](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/circulation) to run. By default, it expects a library registry to be running at http://localhost:7000.

Once you have a library registry or circulation manager, run `npm install` in this repository to set up dependencies.

Then run either `npm run dev` or `npm run prod` to start the application. `npm run dev` will watch the code for changes and rebuild the front-end code, but won't reload the server code.

To configure a library registry url, set the environment variable `REGISTRY_BASE`. To use a circulation manager, set `SIMPLIFIED_CATALOG_BASE` and `SIMPLIFIED_CATALOG_NAME`.

Set `SHORTEN_URLS=true` to make the app remove common parts of the circulation manager URLs from the web app's URLs.

Set `REGISTRY_EXPIRATION_SECONDS` to control how often the app will check for changes to registry entries and circ manager authentication documents.
